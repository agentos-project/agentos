"""
The Specs Types in this file specify which types of objects that can be added
to a Registry. They are literally types, and used in type annotions on core
abstractions.

Though this isn't currently enforced by the types, objects that are Specs
should be serializable to YAML format and are human readable and manageable.

Currently dicts are most often used where a Spec is required by type
signatures.

Specs are always mappings. By default, specs map from an identifier string to
a mapping of key-value properties of the spec; and in some specs such as
ParameterSetSpec, those values can themselves be mappings.

For developer convenience many functions support flattened specs, which have
the spec identifier at the same level as the rest of the spec properties.

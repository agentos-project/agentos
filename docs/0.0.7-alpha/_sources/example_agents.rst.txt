The ``example_agents`` directory of the `AgentOS source repository
<https://github.com/agentos-project/agentos>`_ contains examples of
different types of learning agents.

Existing Agents
===============
The following example agents exist:

* ChatBot
* RLlib agent
* RL Agents

  * Reinforce
  * Deep Q Networks (DQN)
  * Random Neural Network

* Evolutionary Agent
* Predictive Coding

  * Free Energy Tutorial - based on `this tutorial
    <https://sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022249615000759>`_
    by Rafal Bogacz.

Future Agents
==============
Some future example agents that are planned or have been discussed include:

* [`Work In Progress <https://github.com/agentos-project/agentos/issues/57>`_]
  An agent that implements predictive coding in the visual cortex, by Rao
  et al.
* Ports or wraps of popular open source projects including:

  * A digital assistant such as MyCroft_ or Lucida_.
  * More RL frameworks or toolkits such as TensorForce_ or RLKit_.
  * A cognitive architecture such as OpenCog_ or Soar_.

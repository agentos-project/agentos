        States returned are the most recent N strings that have been said in
        the room env, i.e. things that an agent would hear if they were
        standing in a room and somebody said something in that room.

        silent most of the time they call step(), i.e. they will send a message
        with value None. Whenever they want to speak, they will send a message.
